Imagine you have a distributed system with multiple nodes or processes that need to access a shared resource, such as a file or a database. 
To avoid conflicts and ensure that only one node or process can access the resource at a time, you can use a distributed lock.

A distributed lock is like a virtual key that each node or process must obtain before accessing the shared resource. To implement distributed locks, 
you can use an Amazon S3 bucket to store a lock file, and a DynamoDB table to manage the locks.

When a node or process wants to access the shared resource, it first checks the S3 bucket to see if the lock file exists. If it doesn't exist, 
the node or process creates the lock file in the S3 bucket and writes a record to the DynamoDB table indicating that it holds the lock. 
This effectively prevents any other node or process from accessing the shared resource until the lock is released.

When the node or process is finished accessing the shared resource, it deletes the lock file from the S3 bucket and deletes the corresponding 
record from the DynamoDB table, releasing the lock and allowing other nodes or processes to obtain it.

By using Terraform to provision the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table, you can ensure that they are created and configured consistently 
and reproducibly, and that their dependencies and interactions are properly managed.
